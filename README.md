# Popular Navbars re-created with CSS flexbox

The project currently contains navigation bars for the following sites:

1. Facebook
2. Twitter
3. Github
4. Medium
5. Slack Fund

I will be constantly adding navbars as I see interesting ones! (or upon request).

### TODO

* fix link is added directly to end of host address instead of appended to current address:
should be
`mhijack.github.io/popular-navbars/slack` instead of
`mhijack.github.io/slack`
* Fix Github returning 404 when user refresh page in a React single-page-app using react-router

* Finish routing
* Look for more navbars
